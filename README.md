# car_dekho_car_price_prediction_ML
- I have uploaded the ORIGINAL datasets, which is in a COMPLEX UNSTRUCTURED json_string format not suitable for ML.The IPYNB notebooks in which I used various data manipulation and transformation techniques to build a more STRUCTURED and CLEANED datasets suitable for ML.
- I have uploaded the ipynb notebooks today(13/2/2024) where I have built the ML models for five cities-**bangalore_ML_23features.ipynb**,**chennai_ML_23features.ipynb**,**hyderabad_ML_23features.ipynb**,**jaipur_ML_23features.ipynb**,**kolkata_ML_23features.ipynb**.Got good results!!!
